Title: CSS Units Revisited

Notes:
1. In css unit measurement is either static or relative.
2. Examples of static units: pixels, inches, millimeters.
3. Examples of relative units: percentages, ems, rems.
4. Most percentage units are relative to the size of the parent element. Example body>div width:50%, the div will only be 50% of the size of the body. There are some properties that when percentage units are used are relative to something else like the size of the font. Example: line-height: 50%, line-height is 50% of the size of the font of the element.

Summary:
I learned that percentage units have some depth in them. I assumed that it is only relative to the size of the parent element.
