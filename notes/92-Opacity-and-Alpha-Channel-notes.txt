Title: Opacity and Alpha Channel

Notes:
1. Opacity is the opposite of transparency. Meaning that if an element has an opacity of 1 it is completely opaque and wont show any of the color of the parent element. If an element has an alpha channel of 1 then it is completely transparent.
2. Alpha channel is just the measurement of how transparent an element is.
3. Using the opacity css property will change the opacity of child elements as well while alpha channel does not.
4. Examples:
    div{
        opacity: 0.3
    }
    .wakata{
        rgba(255,255,255,0.7)
    }
