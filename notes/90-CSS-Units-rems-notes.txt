Title: CSS Rem unit 

Notes:
1. Unlike the em property value, the rem property value scales off of the root element or <html> font size
2. This is useful since there are no unintended side effects from stacking them.
3. Example: 
            <article>
            <h2> wakarimashita </h2>
            lorem shit
            </article>

4. If we set the article to have a font-size to 20px, and the <h2> to have a font-size of 2rem it will not be 40px in size but rather twice the size of the root <html> element.
