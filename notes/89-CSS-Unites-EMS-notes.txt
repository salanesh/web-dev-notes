Title: CSS Units: EMS

Notes:

<article>
<h2>wakata</h2>
lorem ipsum
</article>

1. 1em equals the font size of its parent element.
   Example: <article> has a font-size of 20px, an <h2> inside it that has a font-size of 2em will have a font size of 40px.
2. For properties that are not font-size, ems works differently, it will instead scale off of the size of the element itself and not the parent.
3. Example: If we set margin-left:2ems it wont be 40px like the example above, instead it will scale off the font size of the element itself which is 40px, so it becomes 80px. 
4. The problem with this is that it causes unintended side effects.
